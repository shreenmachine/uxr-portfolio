    <h1>Customized vs. Pre-Existing Promotional Array Performance</h1>
    <h2>Challenge</h2>
    <p>Marketing content is often heavily focused on sales or other promotions. Standard protocol for advertisement set-up is to create a unique page for the user to click through to, featuring only the products included in that advertisement. However, creating these customized promotional arrays is a labor-intensive project spanning across 3 different cross-functional teams. While there is an option of directing customers to a pre-existing array of similar merchandise on sale (inclusive of all products from advertised promotions) there is a business concern surrounding sales performance when deviating from current strategy. </p>
    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <p>The overarching goal of this research was to determine whether directing marketing traffic to a pre-existing sale arrays on site is a viable alternative to directing traffic to customized sale arrays.</p>
    <h3>Business Goals</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Ensure change in strategy does not negatively affect key performance indicators of Revenue and Conversion Rate</li>
      <li>Reduce overall time spent to produce promotional content</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Research Goals</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Identify if sales performance is tied to traffic driven to arrays customized specifically for that promotion</li>
      <li>Work collaboratively with cross-functional teams to assess best linking strategy</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Research</h2>
    <p>To assess impact of differential linking strategy, five promotional emails were selected to be included in A/B testing of linking strategy.</p>

    <h3>Participants</h3>
    <p>The full Hudsonâ€™s Bay email subscriber distribution list was used for the participant pool.</p>
    <h3>Methodology</h3>
    <p>The email distribution list was split evenly into two groups. Both segments were set to receive the same creative assets as to reduce extraneous variables that could affect overall email performance. Group A received emails featuring sales that clicked through to pre-existing promotional arrays, whereas Group B received emails that visually looked the same but that linked out to customized promotional arrays. Revenue and conversion rate was used for key performance indicators in order to assess sales impact.</p>
    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>Differential performance in revenue and conversion rate between Group A and Group B suggests that directing users to a pre-existing promotional array did not have a negative effect on overall sales from advertised promotions. On average, emails that were set up to direct to pre-existing arrays slightly outperformed their customized counterparts.</p>

    <h2>Impact</h2>
    <p>Linking strategy standards have since been updated to direct customers to pre-existing arrays as a best practice. Teams will continue to create custom promotional arrays should there be no means of directing traffic to a pre-existing folder on site.</p>
    <p>An unexpected finding from the research was that emails directing to a pre-existing location outperformed emails directing to a customized page. Further research would be required to understand interaction between landing page experience and purchase behaviour. The initial hypothesis is that pre-existing folders typically have a larger product count than customized folders; more options, more purchases.</p>
    <p>This research helped achieve overall business goals; Strategy update may reduce operational costs in producing promotional marketing for going forward.</p>
    <h2>Reflections</h2>
    <p>This series of tests was integral to gaining buy-in from key stakeholders to leverage A/B testing in order to guide strategy improvements. The simplistic design and easy-to-understand results were well-received among key business stakeholders.</p>
    <h3>Limitations</h3>
    <p>Performance metrics were tied to overall email performance which included content that was not included in testing. Without any means of parsing out performance by promotional offer, there is a chance results were confounded by behaviour tied to performance metrics of non-tested content.</p>
    <h3>Learnings</h3>
    <p>Future email A/B tests will need to be designed in such a way that all content from each test email will be included. This will help to build confidence in conclusions drawn from data analysis.</p>
